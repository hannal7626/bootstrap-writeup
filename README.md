# Bootstrap Writeup
This unit, we began learning bootstrap by tinkering with different elements. 
## Concepts:
## Grid: 
I tinkered with grid in by trying containers, rows, and cols by changing the grid system and sizing from xs-xl using classes that exist on bootstrap's css list. For example, "class="col-lg-6"" inside of a row div to put the columns in a row and both inside a container to seperate groupings. 
## LOYO:
In my bootstrap-loyo classwork, I skim through different components and tried them on jsbin at first. I was trying out the component progess which I found cool and I played around with coloring and loading %. I realized jsbin doesn't support some elements from bootstrap even with the css link after trying carousel fade. So, I sticked with the ide web, carousel and card is perfect for showcasting different foods and I used that in my website. Also in card, I could add descriptions. I added scrolspy ofcourse for it to look more like a web and a search bar where input was needed to work and I'm not sure how to do that. But, I will work on that and hopefully I can get a search bar to work. Lastly, I tinkered with pagination, unfortunately I never added it to my webstite but I plan to have that included on my freedom project.
